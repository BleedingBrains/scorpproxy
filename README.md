#scorpproxy

**scorpproxy** is the fast HTTP proxy server built in java.

A web proxy passes along http protocol requests like any other proxy server. However, the web proxy accepts target URLs within a user's browser window, processes the request, and then displays the contents of the requested URL immediately back within the user's browser. This is generally quite different than a corporate intranet proxy which some people mistakenly refer to as a web proxy.
